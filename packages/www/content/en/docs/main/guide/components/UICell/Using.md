## Definition {#definition}

Cell containers are represented by the {@link UICell} class, which inherits functionality from the {@link UIContainer} and {@link UIComponent} abstract classes.

- {@ref UICell}
- {@ref UIContainer}
- {@ref UIComponent}

## Appearance {#appearance}

A cell container contains other components which are arranged along a vertical (or horizontal) axis. The cell itself can be decorated using a background color, borders, and a drop shadow. By default, a cell takes up as much space as it can within its own parent container, and places all components in the center of the available space.

<!--{{iframesample js="./sample-single.js"}}-->

Like all views, cell containers are often defined statically, rather than being instantiated directly using the {@link UICell} constructor. This way, both the properties of the cell itself and the included content (a list of more preset view classes) can be defined.

```ts
const view = UICell.with(
	{
		margin: 16,
		padding: 8,
		background: UIColor.Blue.alpha(0.1),
		borderColor: UIColor.Red,
		borderThickness: 2,
		dropShadow: 1,
	},
	UILabel.withText("Hello, world!"),
);
```

```jsx
// or, using JSX syntax:
<cell
	margin={16}
	padding={8}
	background={UIColor.Blue.alpha(0.1)}
	borderColor={UIColor.Red}
	borderThickness={2}
	dropShadow={1}
>
	<label>Hello, world!</label>
</cell>
```

Cell decorations, dimensions, position, and layout styles are highly customizable, either using {@link UITheme} styles or using any of the style properties of the container itself.

- <!--{{pagerefblock path="content/en/docs/main/guide/Styles"}}-->

### Layout and content spacing {#layout}

Like all containers, cells can add space around and between contained components. The following properties can be used to control spacing. By default, both are set to 0 for cell containers.

- {@ref UIContainer.padding}
- {@ref UIContainer.spacing}

To move components within the available space, along the primary axis of the component, use the following property.

- {@ref UIContainer.distribution}

For more options, such as for changing the primary axis from vertical to horizontal, use the {@link UIContainer.layout layout} or {@link UIComponent.style style} properties to apply predefined styles.

### Style overrides {#overrides}

Cell containers allow you to change the appearance of the rendered cell by setting simple properties on the instance or preset object itself. The following properties are available.

- {@ref UICell.margin}
- {@ref UICell.background}
- {@ref UICell.textColor}
- {@ref UICell.borderThickness}
- {@ref UICell.borderColor}
- {@ref UICell.borderStyle}
- {@ref UICell.borderRadius}
- {@ref UICell.dropShadow}
- {@ref UICell.opacity}

## Selection state {#selection}

Cell containers automatically keep track of `Select` and `Deselect` events, and set the {@link UICell.selected selected} property accordingly. These events aren't emitted automatically â€” use an event preset and/or a {@link UISelectionController} to manage selection state. You can also use the `selected` state for {@link UIStyle} objects as illustrated below.

<!--{{iframesample js="./sample-select.js"}}-->

```ts
const cellStyle = UIStyle.Cell.extend(
	{
		decoration: {
			borderThickness: 1,
			borderColor: UIColor.Separator,
		},
	},
	{
		// use the selected state to switch styles automatically:
		selected: {
			decoration: { dropShadow: 0.5 },
		},
	},
);

const myCell = UICell.with(
	{
		// emit Select events when clicked:
		onClick: "+Select",
		style: cellStyle,
	},
	UILabel.withText(
		// bind to `selected` property of the surrounding cell:
		bound.boolean("selected").select("Selected", "Not selected"),
	),
);

// use a UISelectionController to emit Deselect events too
const view = desk.UISelectionController.with(
	desk.UIColumn.with({ padding: 8, spacing: 8 }, myCell, myCell, myCell),
);
```

## Preset properties {#presets}

The following properties can be preset using `UICell.with({ ... })` or JSX `<cell ...>`.
