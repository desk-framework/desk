/**
 * A class that represents a part of the application that can be activated to display an accompanying view
 *
 * @description
 * View activities represent a possible 'place' for the user in an application, with an accompanying view — a screen, dialog, or a view that's displayed as part of a containing view activity.
 *
 * Views are linked to view activities using the **static** {@link ViewActivity.ViewBody ViewBody} property. Using the constructor referenced by this property, views are created and rendered automatically when the activity becomes active. Views are also automatically removed again when the activity is deactivated. Alternatively, override the {@link ViewActivity.createViewAsync()} method to change the way views are created for a particular type of activity.
 *
 * The base ViewActivity class doesn't specify how views should be rendered; use the {@link PageViewActivity} or {@link DialogViewActivity} classes instead for main view activities, or set the {@link ViewActivity.renderPlacement renderPlacement} object in the constructor with options defined by {@link RenderContext.PlacementOptions}.
 *
 * View activities can also be nested (attached to a containing view activity), and rendered using {@link UIViewRenderer}.
 *
 * Finally, view activities may be able to re-render dynamically in 'hot reload' scenarios; refer to {@link GlobalContext.hotReload app.hotReload()} for details.
 *
 * @see {@link PageViewActivity}
 * @see {@link DialogViewActivity}
 *
 * @example
 * // Create a view activity and activate it:
 * import MyView from "./MyView.js";
 * class MyActivity extends ViewActivity {
 *   static override ViewBody = MyView;
 *   constructor() {
 *     super();
 *     this.renderPlacement = { mode: "mount", mountId: "app" };
 *   }
 *   override protected async afterActiveAsync() {
 *     console.log("MyActivity is now active");
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * app.addActivity(new MyActivity(), true);
