/**
 * A class that represents a part of the application that can be activated when the user navigates to it
 *
 * @description
 * The activity is one of the main architectural components of a Desk application. It represents a potential 'place' in the application, which can be activated and deactivated when the user navigates around.
 *
 * This class provides infrastructure for path-based routing, based on the application's location, such as the browser URL. However, activities can also be activated and deactivated manually, or activated immediately when added using {@link GlobalContext.addActivity app.addActivity()}.
 *
 * Activities emit `Active` and `Inactive` change events when state transitions occur.
 *
 * This class also provides a {@link view} property, which can be set to a view object. Usually, this property is set in the {@link Activity.ready()} method. Afterwards, if the activity corresponds to a full page or dialog, this method should call {@link app} methods to show the view. The view is automatically unlinked when the activity is deactivated, and the property is set to undefined.
 *
 * @example
 * // Create an activity and activate it:
 * class MyActivity extends Activity {
 *   path = "foo";
 *   protected ready() {
 *     this.view = new body(); // imported from a view file
 *     app.showPage(this.view);
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * app.addActivity(new MyActivity());
 * app.navigate("/foo");
