/**
 * A class that encapsulates a dynamic view
 *
 * @description
 * View composites contain a single (attached) view object. ViewComposite instances are themselves also views, and as such can be included in a view hierarchy or used as the view object of an {@link Activity}. When rendered, view composites display the contained view component.
 *
 * The encapsulated view is referenced by the {@link ViewComposite.body body} property, which is usually set automatically, either when the ViewComposite is instantiated or right before rendering. It may be changed or unlinked at any time; the rendered view will be updated accordingly by the ViewComposite itself.
 *
 * The {@link ViewComposite.body body} property is watched using {@link ManagedObject.autoAttach}, which means that setting it to a view instance automatically attaches the object to the ViewComposite. Setting the property to undefined will unlink the existing view, and setting it to a new view will unlink an existing one. Therefore, the ViewComposite instance can only contain a single view object at a time.
 *
 * Since the view is attached to the ViewComposite object, bindings continue to work, and events can be handled either by the ViewComposite object or by a containing object.
 *
 * View composites are primarily used in two different ways:
 *
 * - As a way to _control_ an encapsulated view. Refer to e.g. {@link UIConditionalView} and {@link UIListView}, which are built-in ViewComposite classes.
 * - As a way to create reusable view structures. Refer to the static {@link withPreset()} method which can be used to create a ViewComposite class using a function and/or a class.
 *
 * Note the similarities with the {@link Activity} class, which also encapsulates a single view object. As a rule, use _activities_ if event handlers or other class methods include business logic. Use view _composites_ if the class is only concerned with the look and feel of a set of UI components, and all content can be preset, bound, or provided by a view model.

export abstract class ViewComposite<TView extends View = View> extends View {
	/**
	 * Creates a reusable view composite class
	 *
	 * @summary This method can be used to define a reusable view, containing built-in UI components or other views. The resulting class can be used directly in a view.
	 *
	 * Common use cases for view composites include complex field inputs such as date and time pickers, containers such as cards, accordions, tabs, and split views, and application layout templates.
	 *
	 * @param defaults A set of default property values, bindings, and event handlers that will be applied to each instance of the view composite; also determines the preset object type and JSX tag attributes
	 * @param ViewBody A view class, or a function that returns a view class; an instance of this view will be encapsulated by each view composite object — moreover, if a function is provided, it is also used to define rest parameters for the preset method
	 * @returns A new class that extends `ViewComposite`
	 *
	 * @description
	 * This method creates a new class that extends {@link ViewComposite}, which encapsulates and renders a view object. The constructor of the resulting class takes a single object argument, a preset object, which is applied to the instance using {@link View.applyViewPreset()} — setting properties, applying bindings, and adding event handlers. The preset object type follows from the type parameters and/or the provided defaults object.
	 *
	 * The resulting class can be used as a JSX tag on its own, with attributes corresponding to the properties of the (default) preset object. Note that the JSX tag does't create an instance, but a class that _further_ extends the view composite class. Outside of JSX code, the static `preset()` method can be used for the same purpose.
	 *
	 * @note Note that while view _composites_ and view _activities_ are very similar, as a rule, view composites should not include any business logic (in event handlers or other methods). Hence, use this function only to define groups of UI components and determine their look and feel. Where more code is required, consider either view activities, or view models that can be passed around in your code.
