/**
 * The base class of all managed objects, which can be placed into a tree structure to enable event handling and data binding
 *
 * @description
 * The ManagedObject class is the core construct that powers framework concepts such as event handling and property binding. Many of the other classes are derived from ManagedObject, including {@link ManagedList} and {@link ManagedRecord}. This class provides the following features:
 *
 * **Object lifecycle** — The {@link ManagedObject.unlink unlink()} method marks an object as stale, and disables the other features below. Objects can add additional lifecycle behavior by overriding the {@link ManagedObject.beforeUnlink beforeUnlink()} method.
 *
 * **Attaching objects** — Managed objects are meant to be linked together to form a _directed graph_, i.e. a tree structure where one object can be 'attached' to only one other managed object: its parent, origin, or containing object. In turn, several objects can be attached to every object, which makes up a hierarchical structure.
 *
 * - Objects can be attached using the {@link ManagedObject.attach attach()} method. A callback function can be used to listen for changes.
 * - When an object is unlinked, its attached objects are unlinked as well.
 *
 * **Events** — The {@link ManagedObject.emit emit()} method 'emits' an event from a managed object. Events are instances of {@link ManagedEvent}, which can be handled using a callback provided to the {@link ManagedObject.listen listen()} method, or an {@link Observer} that's currently observing the object. Typically, objects are observed by their parent object (the object they're attached to). This enables event _propagation_, where events emitted by an object such as a {@link UIButton} are handled by a managed object further up the tree — such as an {@link Activity}. Refer to {@link ManagedEvent} for details.
 *
 * **Property bindings** — Whereas events typically flow 'up' a tree towards containing objects, data from these objects can be _bound_ so that it makes its way 'down'. In practice, this can be used to update properties such as the text of a {@link UILabel} object automatically when a particular property value is set on a containing object such as the {@link Activity}. Refer to {@link Binding} for details.

	 * @returns The object itself, or an async iterable if no parameter was provided
	 *
	 * @description
	 * This method adds a listener for all events emitted by this object. Either a callback function or an object with callback functions can be provided, or this method returns an async iterable that can be used to iterate over all events.
	 *
	 * **Callback function** — If a callback function is provided, it will be called for every event that's emitted by this object. The function is called with the `this` value set to the managed object, and a single event argument. The callback function can be asynchronous, in which case the result is awaited to catch any errors.
	 *
	 * **Callbacks object** — If an object is provided, its functions (or methods) will be used to handle events. The `handler` function is called for all events, and the `unlinked` function is called when the object is unlinked. The `init` function is called immediately, with the object and a callback to remove the listener.
	 *
	 * **Async iterable** — If no callback function is provided, this method returns an async iterable that can be used to iterate over all events using a `for await...of` loop. The loop body is run for each event, in the order they're emitted, either awaiting new events or continuing execution immediately. The loop stops when the object is unlinked.
	 *
	 * @note This method adds a permanent listener. To prevent memory leaks, it may be better to use an {@link Observer} that can be stopped when needed, if the object is expected to outlive the listener.
	 *
	 * @example
	 * // Handle all events using a callback function
	 * someObject.listen((event) => {
	 *   if (event.name === "Foo") {
	 *     // ...handle Foo event
	 *   }
	 * });
	 * // ... (code continues to run)
	 *
	 * @example
	 * // Handle all events using an async iterable
	 * for await (let event of someObject.listen()) {
	 *   if (event.name === "Foo") {
	 *     // ...handle Foo event
	 *   }
	 * }
	 * // ... (code here runs after object is unlinked, or `break`)
