/**
 * The base class for an observer that watches a particular {@link ManagedObject}
 *
 * @description
 * Observers can be used to watch particular objects (instances of {@link ManagedObject} or any subclass, including {@link ManagedList}, {@link ManagedRecord}, etc.), specifically to:
 *
 * - Listen for events (see {@link Observer.handleEvent handleEvent()}, which can be overridden or used to dispatch events to specific Observer methods).
 * - Check when the object is attached (see {@link Observer.handleAttachedChange handleAttachedChange()}, which can be overridden).
 * - Check when the object is unlinked (see {@link Observer.handleUnlink handleUnlink()}, which can be overridden).
 * - Handle property changes (see {@link Observer.observeProperty observeProperty()} and {@link Observer.observePropertyAsync observePropertyAsync()} which must be called to observe a property).
 *
 * Before any property can be observed, the `observeProperty*()` method must be called. This should be done within the {@link Observer.observe observe()} method, which must be overridden. Refer to the examples below.
 *
 * Observers can be created manually (using `new`, and the {@link Observer.observe observe()} method), but they can also be passed to {@link ManagedObject.attach()} and {@link ManagedObject.observeAttach()} to observe attached objects. Refer to the examples below.
 *
 * The observer is automatically stopped when the target is unlinked, but it can also be stopped manually (see {@link Observer.stop stop()}). This may be necessary to avoid memory leaks, since observers are linked to the observed object while they're active — keeping them (and any referenced objects) from being freed up by the JavaScript garbage collector as long as the observed object is referenced itself.
 *
 * @online_docs Refer to the Desk website for more information on using observers.
