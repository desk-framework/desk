/**
 * A class that represents a part of the application that can be activated when the user navigates to it
 *
 * @description
 * The activity is one of the main architectural components of a Desk application. It represents a potential 'place' in the application, which can be activated and deactivated when the user navigates around.
 *
 * This class provides infrastructure for path-based routing, based on the application's location, such as the browser URL. However, activities can also be activated and deactivated manually.
 *
 * Activities emit `Active` and `Inactive` change events when state transitions occur.
 *
 * @note The base Activity class does **not** render a view. Use the {@link ViewActivity} class instead for an activity that renders an accompanying view.
 *
 * @see {@link ViewActivity}
 *
 * @example
 * // Create an activity and activate it:
 * class MyActivity extends Activity {
 *   constructor() {
 *     super();
 *     this.path = "foo";
 *   }
 *   override protected async afterActiveAsync() {
 *     console.log("MyActivity is now active");
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * app.addActivity(new MyActivity());
 * app.navigate("/foo");
