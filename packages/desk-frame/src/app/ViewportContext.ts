/**
 * Interface definition for an object that contains information about the user's viewport, e.g. browser window
 *
 * @description
 * A ViewportContext object is available on the global application context, as {@link GlobalContext.viewport app.viewport}. This instance can be used to customize the UI for different viewport sizes â€” either directly or through a binding.
 *
 * @online_docs Refer to the Desk website for more information on responsive design and the viewport context.
 *
 * @example
 * // Determine the viewport size directly:
 * if (app.viewport.portrait) {
 *   // ...do something specific here
 * }
 *
 * @example
 * // Bind to viewport properties from a JSX view:
 * <conditional state={bound("viewport.wide")}>
 *   // ...view for wide viewports
 * </conditional>
