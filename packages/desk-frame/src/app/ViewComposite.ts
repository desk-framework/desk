/**
 * A class that encapsulates a dynamic view
 *
 * @description
 * View composites contain a single (attached) view object. ViewComposite instances are themselves also views, and as such can be included in a view hierarchy or used for a {@link ViewActivity}. When rendered, view composites display the contained view component.
 *
 * The encapsulated view is referenced by the {@link ViewComposite.body body} property, which is usually set automatically, either when the ViewComposite is instantiated or right before rendering. It may be changed or unlinked at any time; the rendered view will be updated accordingly by the ViewComposite itself.
 *
 * The {@link ViewComposite.body body} property is watched using {@link ManagedObject.observeAttach}, which means that setting it to a view instance automatically attaches the object to the ViewComposite. Setting the property to undefined will unlink the existing view, and setting it to a new view will unlink an existing one. Therefore, the ViewComposite instance can only contain a single view object at a time.
 *
 * Since the view is attached to the ViewComposite object, bindings continue to work, and events can be handled either by the ViewComposite object or by a containing object.
 *
 * View composites are primarily used in two different ways:
 *
 * - As a way to _control_ an encapsulated view. Refer to e.g. {@link UIConditional}, {@link UIStyleController}, and {@link UIList}, all of which are built-in ViewComposite classes.
 * - As a way to create reusable view structures. Refer to {@link View.compose()} which can be used to create a ViewComposite class using a function and a set of event handler methods.
 *
 * Note the similarities with the {@link ViewActivity} class, which also encapsulates a single view object. As a rule, use view _activities_ if event handlers or other class methods include business logic. Use view _composites_ if the class is only concerned with the look and feel of a set of UI components, and all content can be preset, bound, or provided by a view model.
 *
 * @note A custom ViewComposite class (such as in the example below) can't be used as a JSX tag using TypeScript. Use the {@link View.compose()} method instead, which produces a builder function that can be used from JSX code while also exposing a typed `.with()` method for non-JSX code.
 *
 * @example
 * // A custom view composite
 * const BodyView = (
 *   <cell>
 *     <label>Count: %[count]</label>
 *     <primarybutton onClick="CountUp">Count</primarybutton>
 *   </cell>
 * );
 *
 * class CounterView extends ViewComposite {
 *   constructor () {
 *     super();
 *     this.body = new BodyView();
 *   }
 *   count = 0;
 *   onCountUp() { this.count++ }
 * }
